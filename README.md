<b>Key points:
- [ ] Use React and Redux to build this app.
- [ ] Use a database(MongoDB is preferred) to store user's information in it. The App should have a
functionality to show all users that were previously logged in.
- [ ] Create a feature that will allow to sort the products on the main page based on their price, time
created, and name.
- [ ] Set up cookies for user data
- [ ] Prevent unlogged users from going to the main page(or product-details page).
- [ ] Host it on any platform you want(ex. AWS, Heroku etc.)

<b>Bonus points:
- [ ] Use SSR
- [ ] Build some unit tests for this App(ex. using jest, mocha etc.)
- [ ] Implement pagination for the main page, so it will show 20-25 products per page.
